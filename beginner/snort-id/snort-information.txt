Installing Snort onto Kali:
	* ‘sudo apt install snort -y’

(see snort-installation.png for version)

Understanding Snorts File Structure:

1. Important Snort directories
	* ‘ls /etc/snort’

I went through the snort files to ensure I understood how the layout is.

2. Create a custom rules file
https://docs.snort.org/start/rules

	* ‘sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/test.rules’

Inside the new test rules ‘alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP test ping detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)’

3. Set up HOME_NET
	* ‘sudo nano etc/snort/snort.lua’
	* Replace ‘HOME_NET = ‘any’’ into ‘HOME_NET = ‘{internet}’’ | For my vm, that is 192.168.30.0/24

(See home_net-config.png for the changed config file)

Run Snort in IDS mode and trigger the new rule:
	* ‘sudo snort -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.lua -R /etc/snort/rules/test.rules -A alert_fast’
cheat-sheet:
-i eth0 | Listen on the VM interface
-c | Use the main Lua config
-R | Use the test rule file directly
-A alert_fast | Readable alert format

(See enabled-listening.png to see the logs)

4. Ping the Kali VM from a different VM
	* ‘sudo snort -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.lua -A alert_fast -k none’

After a short while the terminal will begin showing the pings from the other VM. You can also have another terminal up using
	* ‘sudo tcpdump -i eth0’

(See snort-ping-logs.png & tcpdump-logs.png for the pings)

Understanding the Logs:

This is one of the logs produced by the Snort pings.
