This project is to teach me how to set up and use Snort for intrusion detection. I will be doing this in my personal-lab specifically on my Kali-Linux VM. I will go through the basics of Snort Intrusion Detection to screenshots and document my findings.

Relevant Information:

snort-information.txt | Basic setup and documentation of SnortID
snort-screenshots | A folder for any important screenshots that come up
