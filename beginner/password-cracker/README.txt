This project is to understand how to encode a password (SHA-256), and de-code using password attack techniques.

By setting up a Python cracker.py, and importing 'hashlib' a password will be encrypted. There will be a wordlist and a hash text file created to save the relevant information. The cracker script will be written to has each word from the wordlist and compare it to the target hash (dictionary attack).
