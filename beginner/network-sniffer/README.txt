This project is understanding how to create a Network Traffic Sniffer.

By setting up Python and Scapy, the sniffer will capture raw packets, filter, parse, and display the information. The raw information will be filtered for easy identification. This project is helpful by understanding packets, how they are displayed and possible suspicious ports to detect malicious transport through the network.
