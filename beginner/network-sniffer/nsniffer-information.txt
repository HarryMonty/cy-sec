Understanding Packet Sniffing:

1. What is Packet Sniffing?

Packet sniffing is the process of intercepting and logging traffic that passes over a digit network. It's key purposes are for network diagnostics, malware detection, ethical hacking / penetration testing, security auditing.

2. What is a Packet?

A packet is the basic unit of data transferred across a network. It contains:
	* Header: Source / destination IP, ports, protocol information
	* Payload: The actual data (HTTP requests, login info, file, etc.)
Different protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP have different packet structures.

3. How can you Sniff Packets?

A computers network interface card (NIC) usually ignores packets not addressed to it, however in promiscuous mode it listens to all packets on the network segment. Common methods include:
	* Raw sockets: Gives direct access to packets, lower-level and more complex.
	* Libpcap (Wireshark): Easy to understand, fast, but not easily customizable.
	* Scapy: Wraps raw sockets functionality in Python for quick use.

4. Where do you Sniff from?

Sniffing packets from different areas will result in different types of packets:
	* Local Device: You will only see traffic your device sends/receives.
	* Router / Bridge: You can see everything on the network.

5. Passive vs Active Sniffing

	* Passive Sniffing: Listening to what's already on the network.
	* Active Sniffing: Injecting packets to re-route traffic.

Initial Setup:

1. Installing Scapy

Ensure python3 is installed on the computer.

'py -m pip install scapy' | Successfully installs Scapy (PowerShell Terminal)

2. Install NPCap

Capturing Raw Packets:

1. Write a Basic Packet Sniffer

from scapy.all import sniff

def packet_handler(packet):
    print(packet.summary())

sniff(prn=packet_handler, count=10)

2. Run the script through terminal

'py sniffer.py'

(See nsniffer-rawpackets.png for logs of this script)

Filtering Raw Packets:

1. Modify sniffer.py to use scapy imports for filtering

(See sniffer.py for full code & nsniffer-filteredpackets.png for the terminal logs)
