Allowing Webcam through Kali VM:

Allowing the VM to have access to the webcam is the same as a malware having device-level access on a system. Once granted, the malware or attacker can interact directly with the webcam, just like any authorized application or process.

Installing Dependencies:
	* 'v4l2-ctl' | VirtualBox Dependency to allow access to the webcam
	* 'fswebcam' | Can take screenshots entirely within terminal

Taking Screenshots:
	* 'fswebcam test-image.jpg' | Takes a photo instantly, saves it in the home folder

This project shows how easy it is once having administration and device-level rights going completely un-noticed.
