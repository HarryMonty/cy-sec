This project is to teach myself the foundational web security protocols by building a secure web app. The app itself will be a simple register and login app, but the app has security first built in (DevSecOps) this includes input validation, authentication, encryption (bcrypt), and safe session handling. This will be done by building an app using Python (Flask) for backend, basic HTML5/CSS3 for the frontend, and a database file.
