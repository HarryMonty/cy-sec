This project is to understand keylogging, and how it is used ethically in industry security.

Using Python and the dependencies, a script will be create a listener to detect and log keys. The keys will be saved into a log, and ensured to be easily readable. The log file will be secured with basic encoding, and tested in a virtual machine.
