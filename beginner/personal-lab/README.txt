This is a Personal Cyber-Security lab, which will have a Kali-VM and Windows-VM setup. It will be mainly used for ethical hacking, simulating real world threats, and dissecting malware for reverse engineering.

The VM will be under full isolation, and no shared files or folders to the host OS. The VM being used will be VirtualBox (same VM used in the honeypot project).

Relevant Files:

plab-information.txt | Information about the person-lab
plab-screenshots | Important screenshots taken throughout the setup process
VMs | The folder for the Virtual Machines being used in the lab (future tests will be held in here too)

VMS WILL NOT SHOW UP IN GITHUB - THE FILES ARE TOO LARGE AND WILL BE IGNORED
