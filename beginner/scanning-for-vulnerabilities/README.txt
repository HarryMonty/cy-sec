This project is to scan my home network for any vulnerabilities. This will be done using a Kali-Linux VM, using the tools and software pre-installed on the machine.

NMap will be used to scan the local network and find any vulnerabilities. Nikto will then be used to get a deeper understanding of the found vulnerabilities.

The scans being performed were done on an Apache + phpMyAdmin setup on a live XAMPP server on my host computer.
